One morning a man got up and put on a Dirndel.
After doing so, he packed his last bag, grabbed a snack, and left for the Flughafen.
Along his way he saw a beautiful Schloss!
His flight wasn't for a few hours, so he decided to stop at the local Biergarten.
He lost track of time, and needed to speed across the city to board the flight in his bright pink BMW.
He cranked up the klimaanlage, cooling him as he weaved through traffic.
Feeling speedy, he got on the Hauptstrasse to reach the Flughafen faster.
The man was so hungry that he pulled off on the nearest exit to visit a baeckerei for a pre-flight snack.
He left the baeckerei with a apfelkuchen and gebaeck. He took a small walk while eating and fed the gebaeck to a street hund. 
He forgot the Bratwurst in hsi pocket, and ate that too.
